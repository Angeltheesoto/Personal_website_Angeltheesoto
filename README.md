## Bugs

- Currently when you click on the projects in /project, you have to click the same button twice for the data to show up.

## Technologies

<!--
WORKING ON:
 1. Add loader when data is being rendered in in the projectpage.js
 2. Make the data be dynamic in project.js so it will display as much buttons as there are data being passed into localstorage or backend.
 3. Change Profile section to something else. Dont show your face.
 4. Add Scroll to top button at bottom of page.

 ⭐5. Try and hide important information:
      1. environment variables to heroku
      2. untrack env file
      3. maptiler key.
